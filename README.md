## About

This repository will build a [Nginx](https://www.nginx.org) w/[PHP-FPM](https://php.net) docker image, suitable for serving PHP scripts, or utilizing as a base image for installing additional software.

* This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) or [Debian Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/debian) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash` `curl` `less` `logrotate` `nano` `vim`
* Tracking PHP 5.3-8.0
* Easily enable / disable extensions based on your use case
* Automatic Log rotation
* Composer Included
* XDebug capability
* Caching via APC, opcache
* Includes client libraries for [MariaDB](https://www.mariadb.org) and [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org)

## Installation

Builds of the image are available on [Docker Huby](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/nginx-php-fpm) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull tiredofit/nginx-php-fpm:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their taged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

### Multi Arch
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v6`, `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

## Configuration


### Data-Volumes

The container starts up and reads from `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` for some basic configuration and to listen on port 73 internally for Nginx Status responses. `/etc/nginx/conf.d` contains a sample configuration file that can be used to customize a nginx server block.

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory   | Description                |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `/www/html` | Root Directory             |
| `/www/logs` | Nginx and php-fpm logfiles |

* * *
### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

Be sure to vierw the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                  | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [OS Base](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-alpine/) | Customized Image based on Alpine Linux |
| [Nginx](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-nginx/)    | Nginx webserver                        |


#### Container Options

The container has an ability to work in 3 modes, `nginx-php-fpm` (default) is an All in One image with nginx and php-fpm working together, `nginx` will only utilize nginx however not the included php-fpm instance, allowing for connecting to multiple remote php-fpm backends, and finally `php-fpm` to operate PHP-FPM in standalone mode.


| Parameter        | Description                                                   | Default         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `CONTAINER_MODE` | Mode of running container `nginx-php-fpm`, `nginx`, `php-fpm` | `nginx-php-fpm` |

When `CONTAINER_MODE` set to `nginx` the `PHP_FPM_LISTEN_PORT` environment variable is ignored and the `PHP_FPM_HOST` variable defined below changes. You can add multiple PHP-FPM hosts to the backend in this syntax
<host>:<port> seperated by commas e.g.

    `php-fpm-container1:9000,php-fpm-container2:9000`

Note: You can also pass arguments to each server as defined in the [Nginx Upstream Documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html)

## Maintenance

### Shell Access
For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

```bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is e.g. nginx-php-fpm) bash
```
### PHP Extensions
If you want to enable or disable or list what PHP extensions are available, type `php-ext help`

### Maintenance Mode
If you wish to turn the web server into maintenance mode showing a single page screen outlining that the service is being worked on, you can also enter into the container and type `maintenance ARG`, where ARG is either `ON`,`OFF`, or `SLEEP (seconds)` which will temporarily place the site in maintenance mode and then restore it back to normal after time has passed.
